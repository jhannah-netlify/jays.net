Sleep a night in a castle 

Dad input: 

a) For me, the hinge pin of the trip would be the Hannay Family Reunion, held “annually” at Sorbie Rock, Scotland, the last weekend of May. We are inquiring with the clan Hannay Society to confirm that the reunion will be held May 27-28, 2023, “post-COVID.” From Facebook postings it appears the 2023 reunion may be on, and if so, Sharon and I would prefer that date rather than waiting another year. Facebook postings also indicate that the clan dinner is hosted at Creebridge House Hotel, where group rates are offered for the Hannay Clan. Since so much of the Hannay Clan history centers in this area, this hotel might be a focal point for forays into the countryside.  

b) I would prefer to focus on southern Scotland, where it appears the Hannay Clan originated, and northern Ireland, where it appears the Hannay Clan immigrated. I would like to walk the ground they they would have walked, see the sights they would have seen, and visit the hamlets where they lived and the graves where they were buried.

c) I’d like to know what tour groups might be available in proximity to the Hannay Clan Reunion. My impression is that such groups have knowledge of, and access to, the best-of-the-best places to visit, dine, etc. And although they are in some ways constraining due to group size, tour groups provide association with a variety of international folks and offer a worry-free venue that relieve participants of the need for planning, scheduling, making reservations, etc. To me this would be an attractive feature for a portion of our trip (but not all). 

d) I would like to schedule no less than two weeks for the trip, and probably no more than three. I think of this as a “bucket list” trip, and a long-delayed honeymoon (with kids).  :  ) 

e) I will ramp up my research on our branch of the Hannay Clan so we will be more informed about when and where they lived, using ancestry.com, the Internet, our local genealogy center, etc.
