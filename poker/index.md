# CANCELLED

Poker at my house tomorrow is cancelled. We only got 5 players committed, too risky to proceed I think. Better to let everyone loose to make other plans. :) Apologies!

# CANCELLED

I'm heading to Iowa/Ohio to cheer on [Kenny](https://msruntheus.salsalabs.org/2024relayteam/p/kennethelms/index.html)!
Let's play Texas Hold 'Em!

## Covid-19

As far as we know all our friends are vaccinated. If anyone in your household is not feeling well recently
please don't come this month. There's always next month. ðŸ™‚

We're keeping the invite / RSVP list small. 6-9 total players over the course of however many hours.
We love you, but Covid sucks.

## Huey

Our 100 pound dog is a whole thing. He was rescued from an abusive situation, with early trauma.
He'll be separated from the poker room by a gate, or kenneled if he can't relax and behave himself.
Don't try to reach for him.
He loves string cheese. With patience and bribery he can be your friend if you want. ðŸ™‚

## Poker

* All skill levels welcome! Or just come and hang out.
* No limit Texas hold-em. 5/10 cent blinds. $10 buy-in. Bringing small bills is appreciated. CashApp, Venmo, PayPal, Zelle available. Table stakes. No rake. Buy in as many times as you want. Cash out whenever you want.
* If you do not know how to play Texas hold-em, [it's easy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Hold%27em#Rules) We'll walk you through it. ðŸ™‚
* No need to bring anything. I stock some amber / dark beers and aÃ±ejo tequila. If you want an actual meal for yourself, bring it. The house might have zero food in it, or I might have bought way too much food / snacks.
