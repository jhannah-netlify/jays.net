# This is a sample program that illustrates some loop structures and 
# input and output to a file.  
# The file input is from a file in the instructors directory, but the 
# resulting output file is written to your current working directory. 
# Note that to run this sampole program you will have to copy it into your
# perl directory on the server, chmod it executable (chmod 777 runme.pl)
# and execute it with an explicit path (./runme.pl). You should save the 
# output from the program (the three series of cubes) to a file.  You can
# either capture the output in your terminal or use the redirect (>) operator
# to save the output to a file on phpdev.    
#
