***Agile Retrospective
Publisher: Pragmatic Bookshelf
ISBN: 0977616649
Project retrospectives help teams examine what went right or wrong on a
project. But traditionally, retrospectives (also known as
&quot;post-mortems&quot;) are only held at the end of the project--too late to
help. You need agile retrospectives that are iterative and incremental.
You need to accurately find and fix problems to help the team today.

writing shell scripts: What characters do you need to quote? How do you
get variable substitution to do exactly what you want? How do you use
arrays?

Publisher: No Starch Press

chapter focuses on a few important JavaScript features, shows how
professional web sites incorporate them, and gives you examples of how
to add those features to web sites.

Publisher: Syngress
ISBN: 1597491144
Do you want your computer to be absolutely, positively, 100% secure
against all vulnerabilities and exploits both known now and those yet to
be discovered? That's simple--leave your computer in the box it came
in. The only way to be 100% secure is never to turn the computer on.
Once you turn the computer on, you begin a tight-rope-balancing act
</pre><tt>between functionality, convenience, and security.

administrator with best-practice solutions for securing the wireless
network. The book endorses the principle that the best strategy is to
deploy multiple layers of security, each reinforcing the other. Yet it
never strays from its emphasis on the practical; that any tool or
methodology that is deployed must work reliably, allow sufficient
access, and require a minimal amount of maintenance.

***What Is a Wiki? (and How to Use One for Your Projects)
Wikis are becoming known as the tool of choice for large,
multiple-participant projects because jumping in and revising the pages
of a wiki is easy for anyone to do. This article covers how to
effectively use a wiki to keep notes and share ideas among a group of
people, and how to organize that wiki to avoid lost thoughts, and
encourage serendipity. Matt Webb and Tom Stafford co-authored this
article using a wiki, as they did to write their book, &quot;Mind Hacks.&quot;

***The Long View of Identity
Who are you online? Your digital identity is a complex bundle of
information--not just what you say about yourself, but what other people
say about you and how trustworthy they are. O'Reilly editor Andy Oram
recently attended the Identity Mashup conference at Harvard Law's
Berkman Center and reports on one of the most vital issues of privacy
and usability on the Internet.

This year's Open Source conference runs July 24-28 in Portland, Oregon.

of OSCON is that so many different topics are covered in one conference.
It allows you to stretch and learn things from and share ideas with
people solving similar problems using different tools. (5 minute, 47
seconds)
