***Information Dashboard Design
Publisher: O'Reilly
ISBN: 0596100167
Dashboards have become popular in recent years as uniquely powerful
tools for communicating important information at a glance. This book

effective visual design. And if a dashboard fails to tell you precisely
what you need to know in an instant, you'll never use it, even if it's
filled with cute gauges, meters, and traffic lights. Don't let your
investment in dashboard technology go to waste.

</pre><tt>***Inside NetBSD's CGD 
</tt><tt>Security-minded laptop users live in fear of theft, not only of their

computer, but also of their precious secret data. NetBSD's CGD project is

its author, Roland Dowdeswell, on the goals and implementation of the
system.
