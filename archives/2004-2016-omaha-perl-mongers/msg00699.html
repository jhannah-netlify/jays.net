Hello,<br>&nbsp;
<br><div><span class="gmail_quote">On 12/7/05, <b class="gmail_sendername">Bob McCoy</b> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:bob@mccoy.net">bob@mccoy.net</a>&gt; wrote:</span><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">
Truth be told ... I thought your presentation was the only coherent one<br>of the lot (don't even get me started on gaming consoles).&nbsp;&nbsp;I missed the<br>first round of talks during the previous week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously they didn't<br>
set a very high bar for the students.</blockquote><div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gaming consoles talk was a special guest lecture I offered to Mr. Cavanaugh as he was trying to recruit students for a just-added-on-Tuesday special topics course on the &quot;History of Gaming&quot;.&nbsp; Just because a topic may not be of interest to you specifically does not make an irrelevant or &quot;don't even get me started on ...&quot; topic.&nbsp; For the audience of CSCI 2850 students, it was a perfect topic though it had nothing to do with Perl.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly, the first week's presentations were better organized and presented than this week's lectures, which was disappointing to me, especially with a larger audience.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The technical glitch of the computer rebooting and wiping people's
presentation slides off the computer at the beginning of class didn't
help matters much.<br>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Part of the disappointment rests on my shoulders, as I threw this idea of lightning talks at them only three weeks ago and they didn't have a long time to prepare on top of their other classes' end-of-semester work.&nbsp; Having never seen a lightning talk of my own but having only read about them, I was able to give some guidance but not much.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This semester's talks have given me much to think about in how I present the assignment to my students next semester.&nbsp; They will at least know about the assignment from the first day of class and will be more focused in topics they can cover.&nbsp; 
<br></div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">I was also shocked that, as we are now at the semester's end, that no<br>one in that group had any OO exposure.
</blockquote><div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most students in the class have had two or three semesters of OO exposure in C++ and probably Java before getting to the course.&nbsp; The course, however, is structured to be a crash course in Perl including regexes (6-7 weeks), the Apache web server (2 weeks) and CGI programming (the remainder).&nbsp; We do some OO stuff here and there, but that's not the focus of the course.
<br></div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">Here's what I liked most about your presentation -- even though it was<br>ostensibly about operator overloading, the Date example was really
<br>useful at showing the power of Perl modules to solve really thorny<br>issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like getting a bonus presentation.</blockquote><div><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It was a great presentation, if a little long, Jay.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; At 10 minutes, it _was_ like a bonus presentation ... :)
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My goal with the talks was to have them investigate something of interest, something exciting to them and then try to excite the audience about those things, too.&nbsp; It became apparent to me last night that not many of the presenters were excited about what they had chosen, which is a shame since there's so much to get excited about.&nbsp; Perhaps next semester as we go through the semester and they _know_ they're giving a talk on something, they can be looking for topics along the way instead of last-minute.
<br></div><br><blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="border-left: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); margin: 0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex; padding-left: 1ex;">Sandy Vlasnik's class was in there because we had some database projects<br>based on the 
MovieTickets.com site.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that title caught her eye.<br>So we had a &quot;field trip.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while the speaker did manage to munge<br>together information from MovieTickets.com and IMDB, his talk really<br>didn't give any insights into the efficacy or the vagaries of the
<br>process.</blockquote><div><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's difficult to compare Jay's presentation -- by a guy who's been doing Perl for as long as he has and professionally at that -- to the presentation of a student who has only been doing Perl for about 13 weeks and who's just getting his feet wet.&nbsp; I thought that the Google and IMDB::Film presentations were, while rough around the edges, ones that may have sold a few more people on what they can do with Perl.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's a learning process.&nbsp; I expect next semester's talks to be better than this semester's, and once the ball gets rolling and students have seen what's come before them, who knows how good they'll be a year or two down the road.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consider that an early invitation for next semester's talks ... :)<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- b<br></div></div>
