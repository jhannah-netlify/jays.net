this book exposes all sides of Mac fanaticism, from the innocuous to the
insane.

</tt><tt>help

***Interview: Carmen Rizzo--Synthesizing the World
If Carmen Rizzo were in a circus, he&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;d be its best juggler. It&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s
amazing how this Hollywood-based producer, composer, and remixer keeps
artists, songs, technologies, concerts, films, studios, continents, and
even trustees aloft. Appropriately, one of his remixes appears this year
on Cirque du Soleil&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x2122;s 20th Anniversary CD.
