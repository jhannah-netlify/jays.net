  <h1>jays.net Genealogy</h1>Updated 2024-06-14. <a href="https://github.com/jhannah/jays.net/issues">Updates
  welcome</a>.

  <p>Hello! My name is <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I1265.html">Jay Weston Hannah</a>. I'm a computer
  geek currently living in Omaha, Nebraska, USA. My homepage is <a href="http://jays.net">jays.net</a> and my email
  address is &lt;jay(at)jays(dot)net&gt;. This is my fault, so I'm your point of contact for additions, corrections,
  removal, complaints, etc.</p>

  <p><b>2005</b> genesis: Earlier this year I was inspired to take up genealogy as a hobby. Mere months later with much
  help from genealogy genius relatives of mine, family trees lying about, conversations, and lots of data entry I've
  compiled over 4000 of my relatives into my genealogy database (GEDCOM).</p>

  <p><b>2014</b> update: Sadly, both of my cousins, from whom this data originated, have now passed away. RIP <a href=
  "http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I954.html">uncle Larry</a> and <a href=
  "http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I2.html">aunt Kandi</a>. A lot of Kandi's data is also on <a href=
  "http://starkreeder.tribalpages.com">TribalPages</a>. We also have a <a href=
  "https://www.facebook.com/groups/StarkReeder">FaceBook group</a>.</p>

  <p><b>2024</b> update: After our 2023 trip to Scotland and Ireland, <a href=
  "http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I1076.html">Dad</a> finished his research all the way back to <a href=
  "http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I4183.html">Patrick A'Hannay</a>, born in Scotland in 1250. I'm using new
  tools now, see below.</p>

  <p>Some highlights of my GEDCOM</p>
  <ul>
    <li>My Grandfather <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I1581.html">Earl Chapman Humphrey</a> (<a href=
    "https://usshoustondive.com/divers/jay_hannah/">dive team memorial page</a>) served in World War II on the
      <a href="http://www.usshouston.org/">USS Houston CA-30</a> and was a Prisoner Of War for 3 years. He was also
      great at bouncing me on his knee and I miss him.
    </li>
    <li>My GGGGGGGGGrandfather was <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I894.html">William Stark</a>, born in
    1637.
    </li>
    <li>My GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGrandfather <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I4183.html">Patrick
    A'Hannay</a>, born in 1250.
    </li>
    <li>The Chapman family bible that is currently in Mom's possession is an amazing book. It's huge, like something
    from a movie set, and contains the family and descendants of <a href=
    "http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I3992.html">George Chapman</a>.
    </li>
    <li>When Giberson cousins married Stark siblings they caused a <a href=
    "http://jays.net/genealogy/starks_and_gibersons.png">confusing pretzel shaped chart</a>.
    </li>
    <li>PDF: <a href="hannah.pdf">Descendants of James C. Hannah</a> (~ 1774)
    </li>
    <li>PDF: <a href="stark.pdf">Descendants of William Stark</a> (~1622)
    </li>
    <li>PDF: <a href="thomson.pdf">Descendants of William C. Thomson</a> (~1705)
    </li>
    <li>Andria's GGGGGGGrandfather was <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I4062.html">William C.
    Thomson</a>. His son <a href="http://jays.net/genealogy/static-site/I4089.html">James Thomson</a> was born in 1730
    in Ireland. The Thomson family tree, pictured up and right, has 1500 people on it dating back to 1705ish.
      <ul>
        <li>Also see "Thomson Family History" below. It starts at William.</li>
        <li>June Sparks (junetsparks(at)cableone(dot)net) says: The original of this tree hangs on the wall in the
        library of Wabash College, Indiana. The Rev. John Thomson is one of the original founders of the all men's
        college. He held a meeting in his living room where the founders for Wabash met and put it all together - based
        on protestant principles.</li>
