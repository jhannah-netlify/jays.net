(There was another Richard born the same time who I also didsome<br>research on. I wanted to make sure I was working on the right Richard&excl;)This<br>other Richard married a Susanna Allen, moved to Georgia, and was the sonof<br>Peter Ragsdale. It didn&#39;t take long to rule him out as being our Richard. Then I started tracing our Richard and his many moves. Richard marriedRebecca<br>Pollard in Nov. of 1785. (Surr. on this marriage was Wm. Burchett)<br>Rebecca was born in Cumberland Parish, Lunenburg<br>County, VA. Richard purchased a piece of land in Lunenburg County in 1791,<br>which he later sold to his brother Drury in 1792. (Drury later sold thisland<br>himself and moved to Kentucky.) I believe Richard may have purchased thisland<br>with with an inheritance from his father, but this is not proven. Thisland was<br>purchased from John Norris, Sr. and it ran alongside the &quot;Burchett&#39;s&quot;property<br>line. Richard&#39;s sister, Ann, married a Burchett.(She married YoungBurchett, brother of William who was surr. on marriage) Now, when Richard sold the land to his brother, Drury, it was interestingto<br>note the people who signed the deed. Alexander Lester signed and hemarried<br>Richard&#39;s sister, Mary. Elisha Pollard signed it and he was Rebecca&#39;sbrother.<br>Also a George Clarke signed it. He was the executor of Joseph Ragsdale&#39;swill.<br>Joseph is Richard&#39;s father. Also, the description of the property was<br>interesting. The description of the property lines in the deed are statedas<br>follows: &quot;Land lying in Lunenburg County on the Waters of Meherrin River, andcontaining<br>one hundred and eighteen acres more or less, bounded as follows Vis,Beginning<br>at Robert Scotts line, on a branch of Meherrin River thence along Scottsline to<br>Henry Pollards line, thence along Pollard&#39;s line to E___ Burchetts line,thence<br>along Burchetts line to George Clarks line; thence along Clarks line tothe<br>first station;&quot; So here we have quite an interesting connection of people. We have nowtied<br>Richard&#39;s land in with Henry Pollard as well as George Clark. We havealso tied<br>in Robert Scott, who married Richard&#39;s sister, Jane Ragsdale. We also have<br>Burchetts as neighbors who married Richard&#39;s sister, Ann. Now, in 1793 Richard and Rebecca moved to Madison County, KY. He is foundon<br>the tax lists between the years of 1793-1798. This is where my Drury wasborn.<br>In 1799 Richard moved his family to Shelby County, KY where he purchasedmore<br>land. Rebecca died between 1802-05 in Kentucky. In 1805 Richard marriedMartha<br>McDowell. Like you, I found records on the Pollard&#39;s that shows Henry Pollardselling his<br>property in 1793 and moving to Madison County, KY - the same time Richardand<br>Rebecca moved. This was probably the land neighboring Richard&#39;s land in<br>Lunenburg County, VA. Richard is found in the personal property tax books in Shelby County, KYbetween<br>the years 1799-1801. The year 1802 was not legible. Henry County wasformed<br>from Shelby County in 1799 and Richard shows up in the Henry Countypersonal<br>property tax books between 1804-1823. The 1810 Henry County, KY census lists Richard as follows:<br>3 Free While Males age 10-16<br>1 Free White Male age 26-45<br>2 Free White Females under age 10<br>2 Free White Females age 10-16<br>1 Free White Female age 26-45 In 1824 a part of Henry County, KY becomes Oldham County and Richardshows up in<br>those personal property tax books in 1824 and 1825. In 1826 Richard soldhis<br>land to Joseph Fible for $1,414 and moved to Indiana.
