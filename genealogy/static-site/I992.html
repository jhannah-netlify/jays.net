After rallying from thefirst attack he wasso much improved that the family felt quite hopeful.About the 1st of May he was able to ride to the field where his brotherswere engaged in planting corn. But as is so frequently the case, thatdread disease left in his system aserious complication of difficulties,which medical skill and most tender and patient nursing could notovercome. During the last six or eight weeks of his illness, he gavefrequent evidence of improvement, but only to again relapseinto acondition weaker and less able to conquer. Five years ago he professedreligion and joined the M.E. Church. On the 19th day of November, 1889,he was united in marriage to Miss Mary E. Courter, of Scott township. Theafflictedyoung wife, parents sister and brothers have the sympathy of alarge circle of their neighbors and friends, many of whom were present atthe funeral on Sabbath. He was buried from Donaldson Chapel, the remainsbeing interred in thecemetery at Salem. T. S. Pool.</p>
