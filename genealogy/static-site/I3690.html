She had always enjoyed excellent health untilabout four years ago. She was converted when about thirteen years ofage, and has grown up as aconsistent member of the Society of Friends.The life was beloved by all who knew her, because it was so beautiful, sopure and Christian like. Her cultured refined, and graceful bearinginher daily walks of life, will be rememberedby all with whom she came incontact. That loving, beautiful life which had woven itself into noblewomanhood at the age of thirty years, underneath the fostering care ofloving parents, lays it down again without a murmur to Him whogave itand had redeemed it with His won blood when it had served the purpose forwhich it had been given.
