MASSIVE SPOILERS AHEAD. This entire document is a huge spoiler list.

Does this show escalate slower or faster than Breaking Bad does?

## Season 1

E1: Nancy is selling small quantities of weed, only to adults.
One kid (Josh) she's selling to in bulk is young (high school? college?) but he

to kids.

Nancy can expand her territory. Conrad beats the security guard, who returns Nancy's weed.
(Nancy did not ask him to do that.)

grow operation (abandoning the bakery front).

(arson, insurance fraud).

since just after they first met. He doesn't care, he has bigger targets (corruption?).

so Nancy doesn't have to worry about Peter being forced to testify against her drug sales. Silas

(Kesheshian) threatens the grow house.

up to U-Turn (a much larger volume drug dealer). Doug teaches Celia how City Hall corruption works
in Agrestic.

E10: Nancy tries to retire to legit marry Peter. He comes over for dinner, it goes extremely poorly
so Peter and Nancy are now at war. Peter can't do it by the book because he'll lose his job and/or

Armenians all decide to rob Nancy.
